 [Thomas Van Onsem](https://github.com/ThomasVanOnsem),
 [Christoph Ronken](https://github.com/ChristophRonken) and
 [DaniÃ«lle Jongstra](https://github.com/DJongstra).
 
 Thanks to [Len Feremans](https://github.com/LFereman) and other faculty staff 
 for assisting us throughout this project.

## Features

- Students can browse the projects, favorite them and express interest
- Professors can publish project ideas with collaborators
- Smart recommendation system that is personal to each student
- Integration of an existing LDAP system to support login of students and professors
- Options for dark mode and different languages


## How It Works

PostgreSQL is used for the database.
Outside of the basic tables there is also a slightly more complex materialized view and index
created for the search functionality of projects.

Furthermore we have Flask as the main server technology.  
The *src/controllers* folder contains all the endpoints that serve html templates from the *src/templates* folder
and also contains helper endpoints that provide necessary functionality such as retrieving all projects etc.  
The *src/static* folder is served directly. It contains all static files such as images, stylesheets and
Javascript files.  
The *src/models* folder is self explanatory and simply contains all the models in the database along with DAO's to access them.
The *src/tests* folder contains some scenario tests using Selenium. 

Lastly we have the client-side which is Javascript with some JQuery, Bootstrap and
 a couple of smaller Bootstrap related libraries.
 Most data is retrieved by AJAX calls and displayed dynamically on the page.

## Install

### Python

Usage of a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is recommended but not necessary.

To install the packages run the following command

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

If the installation of psycopg2 fails on Linux, try to install the following

```
sudo apt install libpq-dev python3-dev
```

### PostgreSQL

If not yet installed on Linux, do the following

```
sudo apt install postgresql
```

#### Create a new role/password and database

```
sudo -i -u postgres
postgres@server:~$ createuser --interactive
~ Create user with name 'esp'
postgres@server:~$ createdb esp
postgres@server:~$ psql
postgres=# \password esp
~ Enter password
```

### Configuration file

At src/config.py the following should be present

```
config_data = {
    'dbname': '',
    'dbuser': '',
    'dbpass': '',
    'dbhost': '',
    'secret-key': '',
    'file-storage': '',
    'contact-mail': ''
}
```

The *dbname*, *dbuser*, *dbpass* and *dbhost* should of course be set to the values of the
postgresql configuration used.

If the above tutorial on postgresql was followed these values are 
*esp*, *esp*, *chosen_password* and *localhost* respectively.

Fill in the *secret-key* with the result of the following command, as described in the official docs 
[here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/quickstart/#sessions).
```
python3 -c 'import os; print(os.urandom(16))'
```

The *file-storage* has to be an absolute path where the user will be able to upload files to.
Additionally, *file-storage*/home should be a directory with the documents for the home page.

The *contact-mail* will be the address that people will be able to contact for problems/


### Initialize tables

# NOTE: Don't do this when you already have tables. Go to section update table for this.

Now that the database and configuration files are set, we can initialize the tables.
Simply execute the following command

```
python3 install.py
```

If you have an sql file that you want to execute after install, for example a file with inserts to 
populate the database, run the following command instead

```
python3 install.py your_file.sql
```

To initialize the search for your start data, run the following command 
```
sudo -u postgres psql -d esp -c 'REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW search_index;'
```

### Update Tables
When you want to update the tables to the newest version. Run the following command. Here is 24032025.sql the newest upgrade file in the "upgrades" folder.
```
python upgrade_downgrade_db.py upgrade 24032025.sql  
```

### LDAP

At src/controllers/auth/config.py the following should be present

```
config_data = {
    'server': '',
    'suffix': ''
}
```

This is the LDAP *server* and user *suffix*.
The *suffix* will be added to the user's login before sending the request to LDAP.
Mind that in the case of the UA network, a VPN is necessary to use the LDAP connection.


### Run

Finally, simply execute the following

```
python3 run.py
```
